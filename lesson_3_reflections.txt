When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you're looking to upload for space, if you're looking for feedback, if you want to collaborate with other developers.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling manually allows you to make changes and add your commit while keeping everything logical. I would imagine this is a similar reason why you don't want auto update. 




Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is when you add a new repository to your github account from someone elses. Forking is similar to cloning, but this is only done in github. A clone is a copy of a repository you have taken from github and put locally on your computer. Copying your files to another location in your computer is another example of a copy. Branches are working files that are off-shoots of a master file. These files contain a variation of the master file, but also changes that are made by a developer. These are kept from the main componets until they are merged.
