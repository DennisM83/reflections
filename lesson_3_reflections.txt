When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you're looking to upload for space, if you're looking for feedback, if you want to collaborate with other developers.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling manually allows you to make changes and add your commit while keeping everything logical. I would imagine this is a similar reason why you don't want auto update.
