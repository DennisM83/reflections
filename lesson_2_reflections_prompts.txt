What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

This is usually done on a new repository. This is used to create a new Master Branch.




How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from both the working directory and the respoitory because it acts like a middle ground. 
This helps keep yourself and files you're adding to the repository organized, as well as adding fewer commits.
